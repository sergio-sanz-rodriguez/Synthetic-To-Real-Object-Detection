# Leveraging Synthetic Data for Real-World Object Detection

Training deep learning models for object detection and segmentation with synthetic data offers several advantages, including cost-effectiveness and scalability. Advances in game engines have enabled the generation of highly realistic synthetic images. In this project, a state-of-the-art object detection model, based on the ResNet50_v2 backbone, was trained entirely on synthetic data and evaluated on real-world images, achieving remarkable bounding box precision.
